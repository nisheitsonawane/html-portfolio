<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a passionate gizmo geek who has an eye for analysing problems and ruling out solutions. I aim 
  to be a tech savy professional someday.

</p>

<p>I am also a professional photographer, and paint,dance and play guitar as a hobby.</p>

  Usually people run form engineering. They chicken out and either drop out from undergrad or don't pursue it after 
  their undergrad.
  I went in reverse... I first did commerce, didn't like it so then did PGD in Data Science and Finance
  and started to like coding and now all I do is code.
